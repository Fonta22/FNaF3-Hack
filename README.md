The game **Five Nights at Freddy's 3**, uses a really easy to edit save method, so with some knowledge of it, we can easily hack it!

## `freddy3`
The **save file** is stored inside `%appdata%\MMFApplications`, and it's name is `freddy3`.

The syntax of the file is like `.ini` files, so it's really easy to understand and edit.

## Full beaten game hack
To get the game beaten with all **4 stars**, you have to paste this text inside the **freddy3** file.
```
[freddy3]
beatgame=1

k4=1
k5=1
cine=2
goodend=1
fast=0
nocams=0
hyper=0
vents=0

```

Or download the file in this repository and place it inside `%appdata%\MMFApplications`.

Link to the file [here](https://github.com/Fonta22/FNaF3-Hack/blob/main/freddy3).

This is it! When you open the game you will have all 4 stars.
